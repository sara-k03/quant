# 1.2 How Akuna Profits

- Theoretical value for an option is calculated 
- A bid is sent out (disseminated) below that value to the market
- An offer is sent out above that value to the market
- When another market participant wants to trade that option, they execute a trade on the bid or offer price
- Edge is collected (The difference between the theoretical value and the price the option was bought/sold at)
- Edge adds up over time. 
- Most of the time, there is a loss on these trades, but doing it thousands of times a day makes significant profits for the firm.
